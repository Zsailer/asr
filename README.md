# Python API for doing ancestral sequence reconstruction

This package will become a rewrite of project Lazarus (written by Victor Hanson-Smith), intended to turn this great tool into a readable API. Lazarus is GPLv3 licensed, so this module is forced to inherit the same license moving forward.

The plan is to integrate this module with the `phylogenetics` python package found [here](https://github.com/Zsailer/phylogenetics).

This currently works in Python 3.x

## Installation

While in development, install in development mode with:

```
pip install -e .
```
